## Introduction

This guide shows how to optimize qBittorrent for maximum download speeds by ensuring proper:  
1. Port configuration  
2. Port forwarding  
3. Bandwidth settings  

Key principles:  
- Choose a proper port (avoid 6881-6999 range)  
- Forward ports through firewalls/routers  
- Adjust settings based on upload capacity  

**Warning:** Avoid third-party "optimization" tools - they often contain malware.

### Detailed Introduction

This guide shows how to speed up downloads in the freeware BitTorrent client, qBittorrent. All BitTorrent programs need to have their incoming and outgoing communications flow freely in order to achieve the highest download speeds – and that is what this guide is about.

It was put together using information given by the developers of BitTorrent programs from their forums, guides, and FAQs. There are no secret tricks, just the real basics of a proper BitTorrent client setup. Following these simple steps should result in increased download speeds.

The basic principles for optimizing a BitTorrent client like qBittorrent for speed are: 

- Choose a proper port to avoid ISP blocks and conflicts with other programs  
- Forward that port through any software firewall and router to allow incoming connections  
- Adjust internal settings based on your internet connection’s upload capacity to allow room for outgoing communications and to distribute upload efficiently.  

*Note:* There are programs that claim to optimize qBittorrent speed, but such programs are generally scams that may contain adware or spyware. Developers agree that nothing increases your download speed more than the basic steps set forth herein.

If you are not using qBittorrent, there are several other specific guides for other clients and a general guide available titled “Optimizing BitTorrent Clients.”

## Choosing a Proper Port

### Port Configuration (Initial Steps)

1. **Test your port status:**  
   Visit [canyouseeme.org](https://canyouseeme.org) while qBittorrent is running to check if your chosen port is open.

2. **Locate your current port:**  
   **Tools > Options > Connection** in qBittorrent.

![Port Settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218094638im_/https://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/pc_freeware/free_online_books/optimizing-qbittorrent-speed-qbittorrent-port-location.jpg)

**Recommended range:** 49160-65534

---

### Detailed Port Selection

Before adjusting internal settings, first check if your communications are blocked or clear.  
- Run qBittorrent and test the port.  
- If the test is successful, proceed to “Adjusting Internal Settings.”  
- If it fails, choose a proper port—avoid any within the 6881-6999 range (a range originally used by BitTorrent programs and often blocked by ISPs).  
- The safest choice is a port in the 49160-65534 range. (This range used to be 49152-65534, but newer Windows versions may reserve some of those ports.)  
- **Windows users:** You can check active ports by running `netstat -a > C:\log.txt` from the command prompt and reviewing which ports are in use.

## Port Forwarding

### Firewall Configuration

- Allow both TCP and UDP for the qBittorrent port.  
- Refer to guides on [PortForward.com](https://portforward.com) or your firewall’s help file.

### Router Configuration

There are two methods:

#### Manual Forwarding (Recommended)

1. **Disable UPnP** in qBittorrent (see below for UPnP details).  
2. **Set a static IP:** Refer to a [Static IP Guide](https://portforward.com/networking/staticip.htm).  
3. **Forward the port** in your router’s settings.  

#### UPnP Method

Enable UPnP in both your router and in qBittorrent:
- In qBittorrent, go to **Tools > Options > Connection**.
  
![UPnP Settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218094638im_/https://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/pc_freeware/free_online_books/optimizing-qbittorrent-speed-qbittorrent-upnp.jpg)

---

### Detailed Port Forwarding Instructions

A router will block incoming communications unless an exception is made, and most software firewalls will block both incoming and sometimes outgoing communications unless configured otherwise.

#### Software Firewall:
- Set permission to allow TCP and UDP communications either for the qBittorrent port or the program itself (port-based permission is preferred).

Useful resources:  
- **PortForward.com Firewall Guides** (choose your firewall and then a µTorrent guide as a substitute).  
- The µTorrent forum also has several guides.

#### Router:
- **UPnP (Universal Plug and Play):**  
  *Pros:* Easier setup.  
  *Cons:* May introduce security risks (see Rapid7 findings on UPnP vulnerabilities).  
  If you prefer a secure setup, manual forwarding is recommended.

For manual forwarding, disable UPnP (or NAT-PMP) in qBittorrent, use a static IP, and allow both TCP and UDP communications for the chosen port.

*Additional text reference:*  
> Click “Re-Test Port Success” after making changes. If there’s an error, re-do the steps or seek help in forums. (Ensure any torrent client, like Halite, is running during re-tests.)

## Adjusting Internal Settings

### Basic Internal Settings

The most important setting is to cap upload in qBittorrent to about 80% of your overall upload capacity. If the upload cap is set too high (or unlimited), download speeds may suffer due to interference with outgoing communications (acknowledgment signals, resend requests, etc.). Other settings are adjusted to distribute your upload effectively among peers.

### Speed Test and Calculator Setup

#### Speed Test

1. **Determine your upload speed:**  
   Use [Speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net).  
   - Before testing, press the **Settings** button on Speedtest.net, navigate to “Global Settings,” set “Speed Measurement” to kilobytes, and click “Save.”
   
   ![Speedtest Settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218094638im_/https://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/pc_freeware/free_online_books/optimizing-qbittorrent-speed-speedtest-net-kilobytes-settings.jpg)
   
2. **Take multiple tests:**  
   Stop all other internet activity to obtain an accurate average upload speed. Results will be shown in kB/s.

*Note:* Some ISPs (e.g., Comcast with PowerBoost) may display inflated upload speeds. In such cases, actual speeds may be around 60% of the test result. For example, if the test shows 200 kB/s, the real upload may be closer to 120 kB/s.

#### Calculator Settings

Use the [Azureus Upload Settings Calculator](http://infinite-source.de/az/az-calc.html) with your upload speed:
- Enter your average upload speed (in kB/s) in the calculator.
- The calculator will provide recommended figures for:
  1. **Speed Settings (Upload Limit)**  
     ![Upload Limit](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218094638im_/https://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/pc_freeware/free_online_books/optimizing-qbittorrent-speed-qbittorrent-upload-speed-entry.jpg)
     
  2. **Connections (Upload Slots)**  
     ![Connections](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218094638im_/https://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/pc_freeware/free_online_books/optimizing-qbittorrent-speed-qbittorrent-connections-upload-slots.jpg)
     
  3. **Queueing (Max Active Torrents)**  
     ![Queueing](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218094638im_/https://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/pc_freeware/free_online_books/optimizing-qbittorrent-speed-qbittorrent-queueing-entry.jpg)

#### Inputting Calculator Results

- In qBittorrent, set the **Upload Limit** under **Tools > Options > Speed** (leave the download limit unticked).  
- Adjust **Connections/Upload Slots** under **Tools > Options > Connection**.  
- Configure **Queueing** under **Tools > Options > BitTorrent** to match the recommended "Max active torrents" from the calculator.

*Reminder:* Do not use arbitrary numbers—use the calculator’s recommendations.

## Advanced Settings

Enable the following in **Tools > Options > BitTorrent**:
- ✅ DHT  
- ✅ Peer Exchange (PEX)  
- ✅ Local Peer Discovery  
- ✅ Encryption (Allow legacy connections)

![Advanced Settings](https://web.archive.org/web/20191218094638im_/https://www.techsupportalert.com/files/images/pc_freeware/free_online_books/optimizing-qbittorrent-speed-qbittorrent-dht-pex-lsd-encryption.jpg)

---

## Peer Sources & Encryption

Having the proper peer sources enabled helps increase download speeds by finding additional seeds and peers. Ensure that:
- **Peer Exchange (PEX)** and **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)** are enabled.
- **Local Peer Discovery** is enabled – useful on a LAN or extended network.
- **Encryption** is enabled (and legacy connections are allowed) to thwart ISP interference and access a larger pool of seeds/peers.

These settings are located in **Tools > Options > BitTorrent**.

## Good Torrents

The general rule is to choose torrents that have a high seed-to-peer ratio.  
- **Seeds** have 100% of the content and only upload to peers.  
- **Peers** both upload and download, but their upload capacity is typically lower.

For example, a torrent with 30 seeders and 70 peers (approximately 30% seeders) will generally be faster than one with 500 seeders and 2500 peers (20% seeders) because the average upload capacity available is higher.

For more detailed information, see the guide on **Good Torrents**.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- Port test failures  
- Speed inconsistencies  
- VPN configurations

**When seeking help, provide:**
1. Speed test results (in kB/s)  
2. Port test status (Success/Error)  
3. ISP details
